# What was accomplished during the week:

1) We further polished the game this week, tweaking the scoring system and other small details. 

2) Started to implement geolocation on both client side and server side. 
We record the location of the player when the game is over and send it to the server's database. 
The game center page would render a local score ranking board based on the current location and location data in the database.

3) We successfully rendered the score board page using pug on the server side. 
This week we'll start using Bootstrap to make the game center page look better. 

4) We also successfully implemented the facebook login on our game page.
