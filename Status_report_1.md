Status Report 1 Nov. 18

Created by Siming 

1) We studied Phaser.io and figured out how to create objects and make objects moving in curving trajectory as well as kill the object when we touch it.

2) The difficulty is how to random generate the object and command. Since the command is given to catch a specific type of object, if we random generate object, then it is possible the targeted object is not generated in enough number. We need to consider the quantity the object generated and how we control the command. We might need to redesign the game in terms of counting with scores or counting with time.

3) We are going to figure out the problems in 2 and try to finish the game in the next week and before Nov. 31.
