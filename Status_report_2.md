Status Report 2 Dec. 1st, 2016

By Jialu Wei 

 (1) What was accomplished during the week:
 - We put the client side phaser game ready to play on localhost (yay!).
 - We successfully connected the client to our server, POST and GET routes working.
 - We have started to use Pug to template our html page on the server side.

 (2) Challenges and issues team faced during the week:
 - The idea of templating just came to us, so learning the syntax could be a bit challenging.
 - We are still getting started on how to use Bootstrap.
 - We are stilling considering adding new factors like Facebook login and charts or graphs. They would be implemented if time permits.

 (3) Our goals for the next week:
 Try to finish the basic functions of the project and get it running. If we have time, maybe add the other features.
